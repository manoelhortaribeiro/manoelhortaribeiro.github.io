<div><br/></div>

Establishing causal claims and evaluating systems and models are at the core of
modern Computer Science research. This course provides a rigorous introduction 
to empirical methods, combining foundational theory on causal inference with 
practical applications. Topics include causal diagrams, experimental and 
quasi-experimental designs, regression analysis, and benchmarks. 
Evaluation is based on weekly programming assignments, active class 
participation, and a final paper in which students develop and motivate a 
research project proposal.
